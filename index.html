                    Every day with you is a new chapter filled with love, laughter, and warmth.  
                    You are the melody in my heart, the light in my darkest days,  
                    and the dream I never want to wake up from.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this special day, I just want you to know:  
                    You are cherished, adored, and loved beyond words. ðŸ’–  
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is just a small piece of my heart for you,  
                    but thereâ€™s something even more special waiting for you...  
                </p>
